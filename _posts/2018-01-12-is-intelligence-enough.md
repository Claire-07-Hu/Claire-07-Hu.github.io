### 38'12''

Sweat poured down her face as she breathed heavily, feeling utterly exhausted yet exhilarated. For the first time, she had conquered the trail in just 40 minutes. The incline, notorious among Coloradans for its grueling difficulty, rises 2,000 feet within a single mile. 

Sitting at the summit, she inhaled the cool, fresh 6 AM mountain air.  With peace in mind and the beauty of every moment, her thoughts drifted far away with to the horizon. Memories flooded back of her six-year-old self, when her father first introduced her to this trail. Back then, she couldn't comprehend his enthusiasm for such a seemingly mundane activity. She had whined, cried, and ultimately abandoned her first attempt.

Years later, paradoxically, climbing this trail had become an integral part of her life. She couldn't pinpoint exactly when the switch happened. Was it when she repeatedly failed to land the Axel jump during her ice skating level tests? Or it was when she had to make the heart-wrenching  decision to give up gymnastics due to physical limitations, rendering ten years of training seemingly wasted. Perhaps it was when after her grandmother told her, "Life is a journey, and it's my time," marking the first time she had to confront the reality of death.

With each arduous step up the incline, she would let her internal anxiety, fear, and sense of directionlessness be ground down. She scrutinized these life’s challenges, reflected causes with every stride. Embracing these obstacles became second nature, much like tackling the trail's unforgiving gradient. She drew strength from her loving family, understanding friends, supportive coaches, and the wisdom gleaned from philosophy books. Upon reaching the summit and resting on the familiar rock, solutions often crystallized in her mind. She emerged fortified, both mentally and physically.

Her grandmother's battle with cancer solidified her resolve to pursue a career in medical research, aiming to advance treatments and extend human life. The inevitable departure from gymnastics led to an unexpectedly rewarding journey in tennis.  She gained a profound understanding of the adage "giving up is another way of gaining." Her perseverance culminated in becoming an ice skating coach assistant for the city after conquering the freestyle level 6 exam. There's always an invisible barrier to overcome en route to success. Persistence in the face of initial failures became her mantra.

Like Socrates announced “the unexamined life is not worth living”, if life is like climbing a trail, she assign its meaning through the reflection on every step she take. Every stride was fueled by curiosity, powered by endurance, guided by joy and carried by responsibility. 

As the sun's first rays pierced through her contemplations, she gazed forward. The majestic 14,000-foot Pike's Peak stood proudly in the distance. She knew she is ready for it. 

That girl is ME.
